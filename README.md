# Sort-Visualizer

A sort visualizer is a tool or application designed to demonstrate how various sorting algorithms work by visually representing the process of sorting. Sorting algorithms are fundamental to computer science and are used to organize data in a particular order, such as numerical or alphabetical.

The visualizer typically presents a graphical representation of a dataset, such as bars representing numbers or elements to be sorted. As the sorting algorithm executes, the visualizer updates in real-time to show the changes made to the dataset during each step of the sorting process. This allows users to observe the efficiency, complexity, and behavior of different sorting algorithms.

Some common sorting algorithms that are often visualized include:

Bubble Sort
Selection Sort
Insertion Sort
Quick Sort
Users can typically interact with the visualizer by selecting different algorithms, adjusting the size of the dataset, or modifying other parameters to see how the sorting process changes. Sort visualizers are often used in educational settings to help students understand sorting algorithms and their performance characteristics better. They can also be valuable tools for developers and computer science enthusiasts seeking to explore and compare different sorting techniques.
